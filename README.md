This article describes how a group of scientists have decided to use data to predict COVID-19 surges. There are many ways on how people used data to formulate predictions. In this specific article, they collected data on genomes to make accurately make predictions. I believe it's quite difficult to pick a certain method to make COVID-19 predictions based on how technology has massively progressed in our society. 

New COVID-19 variants, including the emergence of two highly transmissible strains that have caused extensive sickness globally, are predicted to spread by a team of researchers using cutting-edge AI models. The researchers used machine learning to perform a retrospective analysis to find the predictions of the model for distinct locations and globally. The model is a useful tool that speeds the analysis process for even a single person because it has the capacity to process and aggregate enormous amounts of data. It's important to note that the model examined an astounding "6 million distinct genomes".

## Scientists' Model Uses Google Search Data to Forecast COVID Hospitalizations

As I have mentioned before, there are a variety of ways scientists can accurately predict COVID-19 statistics. In this instance, the method of doing it is extracting data from Google Searches. A recent study suggests that it may be possible to predict COVID-19 outbreaks using information from online searches. The number of COVID-related Google searches conducted across the nation was evaluated, and it was paired with established COVID-19 metrics, such as confirmed cases, to forecast hospital admission rates weeks in advance.

The researchers built a computational model that predicts COVID-19 hospitalizations using Google Trends, a real-time web service that offers search volume data. In regions with limited testing or weak healthcare systems, keeping an eye on search trends. The model has outperformed the delay reported in many other models in predicting spikes in hospitalizations associated to novel variations like omicron. The principal researcher for the study agrees that there are certain risks to using Google search data for public health forecasts, including the potential for Google to stop allowing researchers to use their data.
